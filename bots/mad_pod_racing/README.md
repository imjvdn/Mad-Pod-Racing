# Mad Pod Racing (Gold)

## Files

- `bot.py`: paste into CodinGame (Python 3).

## Notes

- Keeps a stable **racer/blocker** assignment by tracking checkpoint progress per pod.
- Racer aims with checkpoint “exit” bias + velocity compensation.
- Blocker targets an intercept point biased toward the enemy leader’s next checkpoint.
